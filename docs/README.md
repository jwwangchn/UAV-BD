## Annotation
We use `roLabelImg` to annotate UAV-BD, this tool can be download in ![this](https://github.com/cgvict/roLabelImg.git) website. You can read `README` carefully to get enough usage information. 

## Visual
In this kit, you can use `python visual.py IMAGEPATH ANNOTATIONPATH` to visual annotation information.

## Evaluate
The evatuation method is similar with the VOC evaluation method.
